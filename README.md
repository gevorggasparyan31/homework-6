# HomeWork 6
Script and stylesheet links were "scattered" all over the code. So at first I gathered them to their right places. 

Then started deleting divs that were under the subscription boxes. They're now rendering using lazy loading. 

Removed unnecessary line breaks. 

Another optimization option also can be removing the modals from html code, and render them only when user will click button, but that can slow down modals'
rendering process. So I just made the modal code look more structured.
